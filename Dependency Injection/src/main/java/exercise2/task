Please implement a PasswordValidator class that has a method validate(String password) that returns a boolean.
The method should return true if the password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one number.
The method should return false otherwise.

Inject the PasswordValidator into a method in the UserService class and use it to validate a password.
