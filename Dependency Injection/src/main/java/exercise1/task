Create an interface logger, that has a method log(String message).
Create two classes that implement the logger interface: ConsoleLogger and FileLogger.
The ConsoleLogger class should print the message to the console.
The FileLogger class should write the message to a file.
Create a userService that has a method that receives a logger and a message and calls the log method of the logger.
Use Constructor Injection to inject the logger into the class.
Possibly demonstrate how you can add different loggers without changing the userservice code.


DO NOT USE A FRAMEWORK FOR THIS EXERCISE

for writing to a file you can use the typical java.io.FileWriter
